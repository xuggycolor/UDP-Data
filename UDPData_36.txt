Swimmer Cat,2,Gacha Super Rares
"Swimmer Cat (Butterfly Cat) is an excellent Single Target Melee Rusher with Massive Damage to Floating. She has 18k HP with 4 KBs, 185 range, 12.6k (37.7k to 50k vs Floating) Damage and 3.1k DPS (9.4k to 12.5k vs Floating), 25 speed, 675 cost and 10s Cooldown. Butterfly Cat is great at suicide-rushing high-range Floating enemies such as Owlbrow and Cli-One between their attacks, as well as delivering heavy DPS to Floating enemies she can outrange like Shy Boy. Her full-backswing attack cycle and high KB count allow Butterfly to rebound when hit, often giving her higher DPS than raw stats suggest. Her stats are also suitable for use as a general rusher, and as a fast offensive meatshield on stages like Floor 30, with enough boost to tank a hit and rebound attack against Hermit. However, her 185 range leaves her vulnerable to fast-attacking frontline enemies who can juggle her for an eternity. Her Single Target also makes her suboptimal against spammed enemies, at best maybe chipping or killing a couple of them before being overwhelmed by the swarm."
"In True Form, Fishman Cat gains significant stat boost across the board. His newly improved stats include 20k HP, 215 range, 15k damage and 3800 DPS, with 36 speed. These improved stats make Fishman much better at his job overall, needing less boost to cripple enemies or rebound from attacks, and outranging more peons to avoid being juggled by them. With Talents, Fishman can reach a blazing 46 speed. This is possibly the most controversial Talent in the game, having a noticeable benefit to his usability as a general rusher but in exchange becoming more suicidal against borderline range matchups, and his rebound attacks against Othom becoming so fast that Fishman is still cursed and does not benefit from Massive Damage."
